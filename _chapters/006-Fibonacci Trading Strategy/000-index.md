abstract: This section explores the practical application of Fibonacci tools to create structured, rules-based trading setups. Moving beyond simple retracements, it details how Fibonacci levels can define precise entry zones, protective stop placements, and logical profit targets. Emphasis is placed on confluence, where multiple Fibonacci measurements align to strengthen a trade idea, as well as the dynamic use of extensions and projections to anticipate market moves before they unfold. These strategies are presented in a step-by-step framework, guiding traders in how to plan, execute, and manage trades with consistency. Additional focus is given to integrating Fibonacci signals with broader market structure and price action, ensuring that Fibonacci is not used in isolation but as part of a comprehensive trading plan.
